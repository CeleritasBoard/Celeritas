/**
 * The measurement process of Celeritas.
 *
 * First it takes a Request as its configuration and sets up all the necessary data structures,
 * then starts the analog hardware (signal) chain, the actual measuring unit and enters the "measurement loop".
 *
 * The measurement loop first checks its running condition:
 * - in case of MAX_HITS measurement we want to count a fixed number of peaks
 * - in case of MAX_TIME, the limit is the maximum value of uint64_t and the time management is done by the scheduler module
 * The spectrometer has an adjustable channel number, that we call the resolution of the measurement:
 *  - In "counting mode" (when the resolution_measurement is 1) we only count how many samples we've got and don't save any channels.
 *  - In "spectrum mode" (resolution_measurement >= 8) we fit the samples into channels (a given range of the whole measurement spectrum).
 *    With each sample we increment the appropriate channel and in the end, send how many samples we've had in that specific channels.
 * 	  Each channel is able to register up to 65535 hits and when one of them has reached it's limit, we say it is filled.
 * 	  At this point we are able to interrupt the measurement process by setting the `request.continue_with_full_channel` option
 * 	  to false. Of course we can proceed, when `request.continue_with_full_channel` option is set true
 * 	  though this way we lose peaks in the spectrum of the filled channels since we can't
 * 	  register any new records on those channels (they do not overflow).
 *
 * When we've finished with the measurement we shut down the analog measurement unit and store the results in i2c_queue.
 * At last we notify the Scheduler that we're finished.
